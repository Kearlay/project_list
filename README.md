<h1 align='center'> Project List </h1>
 
 
 - <a href="https://github.com/Kearlay/research/blob/master/eeg_tensorflow.ipynb">Brain Signal EEG Classification </a><br> Applied stacked CNN, RNN architectures to decode spatial-temporal pattern of multivariate time series brain data. Outperformed state-of-the-art algorithms from the last several years with over 90% accuracy for 5-class classification

#### - <a href="https://github.com/Kearlay/market_prediction/blob/master/market_prediction_news.ipynb"> Market Prediction Based on News Articles </a><br>Processed unstructured text data to predict stock market movements from news headlines. Achieved performance better than a random classification and analyzed pros and cons of vectorization algorithms

#### - <a href="https://github.com/Kearlay/lending_club_classification/blob/master/lending_club_classification.ipynb"> Lending Club Default Prediction </a> <br> Applied feature engineering and visualization techniques to explore a massive scale of lending club history dataâ€“ Built classifiers to analyze default risk of loans and achieved over 96% accuracy

#### - <a href="https://github.com/Kearlay/market_data_mining/blob/master/market_data_mining.ipynb">Stock Market Data Mining</a><br> full historical daily price and volume data for all US-based stocks and ETFs trading on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and NYSE MKT. Constructed a time series model (ARMA) and neural network (LSTM) to model closing prices of stocks over the last decades.

#### - <a href="https://github.com/Kearlay/data_analyis/blob/master/data_analysis.ipynb">MTA Entrance \& Exit Data Exploration</a><br> Cleaned up and analyzed extremely unorganized datasets with more than 12MM time points. Identified outliers applying stochastic distribution and predicted which subway stations did not operate at full capacity

#### - <a href="https://github.com/Kearlay/NLP-project">Natural Language Processing Projects</a><br> This repository contains the python implementation of the recommender systems and sentimental analysis, especially focusing on collaborative filtering. I am attempting to achieve state-of-the-art performances in NLP Collaborated with researchers at Columbia University Medical Center.

#### - <a href="https://github.com/Kearlay/vision">Computer Vision Projects</a><br> The goal of this project was to build machine learning and computer vision models to help automate the process of classification and ships identification in multispectral satellite images. In this project, I processed and analyzed high-resolution raster dataset, built convolutional neural network (CNN) models (Grayscale input and RGB input) and deployed it in AWS.


#### - <a href="https://github.com/Kearlay/data_analyis/blob/master/customer_call/customer_call_analysis.ipynb">Customer Service Data Analysis</a><br> Analyzed the performance of customer service over multiple regions, agents, and supervisors. I tried to extract meaning business insights from the dataset. Predictive modeling and experimental designs were applied.


#### - <a href="https://github.com/Kearlay/dna_disease_classification/blob/master/dna_disease_classification.ipynb">DNA Data Analytics</a><br> This problem simulates two datasets (DS) of patients whose blood samples whose cell-free DNA has been investigated. I built a custom library to classify those with disease A or B.
