 this notebook, I will try to build two predictive models for forecasting. The first one is a conventional example. ARIMA and SARIMAX models are suggested to fit the stock prices of Exxon Mobile. The second approach is more trendy and by far one of the most complex model for time series forecasting. A deep neural network with LSTM layers are trained on the entire dataset, i.e., stock prices records of over thousands of companies. Lastly, I will compare the pros and cons of the two models.

</a><br>
This is the Car sales data set which include information about different cars . This data set is being taken from the Analytixlabs for the purpose of prediction
In this we have to see two things
First we have see which feature has more impact on car sales and carry out result of this
Secondly we have to train the classifier and to predict car sales and check the accuracy of the prediction.
