 this notebook, I will try to build two predictive models for forecasting. The first one is a conventional example. ARIMA and SARIMAX models are suggested to fit the stock prices of Exxon Mobile. The second approach is more trendy and by far one of the most complex model for time series forecasting. A deep neural network with LSTM layers are trained on the entire dataset, i.e., stock prices records of over thousands of companies. Lastly, I will compare the pros and cons of the two models.

Analyzed extremely unorganized data with text, image, location, and numeric features and achieved the accuracy over 68% for 3-class classification with hyper-parameter tuning on regularized random forest

</a><br>
This is the Car sales data set which include information about different cars . This data set is being taken from the Analytixlabs for the purpose of prediction
In this we have to see two things
First we have see which feature has more impact on car sales and carry out result of this
Secondly we have to train the classifier and to predict car sales and check the accuracy of the prediction.

Applied and compared multi-gram vectorizers, three different feature selectors, and predictive algorithms to achieve 47% of f1 score and 0.89 of AUC

</a><br>
For each time series, the data provide the name of the article as well as the type of traffic that this time series represent (all, mobile, desktop, spider). I will use this metadata and any other publicly available data to make predictions. Unfortunately, the data source for this dataset does not distinguish between traffic values of zero and missing values. A missing value may mean the traffic was zero or that the data is not available for that day.
